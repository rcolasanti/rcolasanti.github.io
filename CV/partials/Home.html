          <p>I was lucky enough to discover that I really enjoy computer programming, so on the back of that I got a Ph.D. from the University of Sheffield and my partner Diane and I have spent the last 10 years doing post doc placements in the US and Australia. We are now back Wales, where I am researching the visualisation of open source data sets and I can get a proper cup of tea.</p>

          <h2>Programming experience</h2>
          <p>I have had a varied and exciting career as a programmer. I have worked for a movie promotion company writing screen-savers and web games for films from Star Trek to Beavis and Butthead. I have been the senior developer for a biotech start up and created three patented drug discovery programs. I have written computer models of low level radioactive waste, the spread of invasive trees in Australia, and genetically modified grass in the USA. I have even written a biome control program that ran on the old BBC B microcomputer. I was also the lead cyber-ecologist for a sims game company Cyberlife. My current project involves the visualization of open source data networks and the use of gamification for measuring user perception of visual data.</p>
