          <p>I was lucky enough to discover that I really enjoy computer programming, so on the back of that I got a Ph.D. from the University of Sheffield and my partner Diane and I have spent the last 10 years doing post doc placements in the US and Australia. We are now in Hull, Yorkshire, where I am researching deep learning for time series classification and we can get a proper cup of tea.</p>

          <h2>Employment</h2>
          <p>I am a proficient and committed scientific researcher with extensive expertise in scientific computing in particular, biological data analysis and modelling.I have recently successfully applied data mining techniques to both predicting the phenotype of bacteria from their genotype and to the diagnosis of respiratory behaviour from breathing patterns. I have previously used both cellular automata and agent based modelling methods to wound healing, microbial ecology and invasive plant species. I have strong programming skills in a number of languages particularly Java and Python.I have worked extensively abroad and throughout the UK in range of commercial, clinical,academic and governmental posts.   </p>

          <h2>Qualifications</h2>
          <p>I have a PhD from the University of Sheffield for research in computational ecology. I also have an MSc in evolutionary and adaptive computing from the University of Sussex.  I have recently upgraded my computing skills by obtaining an MSc in computing from Cardiff University. Most recently, because I wish to pass on my passion for programming to  others I have added a PGCE (PCET) from Cardiff University which included teaching practice at the school of computer science.</p>

          <h2>Programming experience</h2>
          <p>I have had a varied and exciting career as a programmer. I have worked for a movie promotion company writing screen-savers and web games for films from Star Trek to Beavis and Butthead. I have been the senior developer for a biotech start up and created three patented drug discovery programs. I have written computer models of low level radioactive waste, the spread of invasive trees in Australia, and genetically modified grass in the USA. I have even written a biome control program that ran on the old BBC B microcomputer. I was also the lead cyber-ecologist for a sims game company Cyberlife. My current project involves time series prediction of biochemical signaling networks using LSTM coded in Tensorflow. </p>
